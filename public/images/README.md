# Player Profile Images

Place the following images in this directory:

- `max.jpg` - Profile photo for Max Kirkby
- `will.jpg` - Profile photo for Will Dixson
- `loki.jpg` - Profile photo for Loki Bromilow
- `charlie.jpg` - Profile photo for Charlie O'Neill

## Image Guidelines

1. Use square images for best results (1:1 aspect ratio)
2. Recommended size: 400x400 pixels or larger
3. Make sure the person's face is clearly visible
4. Headshots work best for the comparison layout
5. Use JPG format for best compatibility

If images are not available, the app will display a fallback with the person's first initial.
